# currently, there is no workflow to auto publish to pypi, so its done manually like this:

git commit -am "new release"
git push
git tag --list  # create a new version after the latest one with same format.
git tag -a vx.y -m "new release"
git push --tags
# build and push to pypi
. activate_ve ve
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
twine upload dist/*
